    It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov).
    This DMCA Policy, Notice and Takedown Procedure page describes the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to Fade 2 Karma as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. If we receive proper notification (as outlined below) of claimed copyright infringement, our response to such notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating contributors, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.
    If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the creator of the affected content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.
